# abstracter

abstracter is web app i made for friend who needed to classify some abstracts. 

I took these abstractes and stored them into mongo. The web app retrieve one by one and the user label them using a form.

The labeled abstract is then stored in mongo. 

As i said, it was intended to help a friend to develop a data collection for machine learning project.
